3144,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,"Well, yeah, I did...",male,2007
3145,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,"Sirius told me you believed there was a snake inside of you. This was Voldemort attempting to manipulate you. To protect you from this, I had you study Occlumency.",male,2007
3146,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,But Snape stopped giving me lessons.,male,2007
3147,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,"Yes. I thought he could overcome his feelings towards your father, but I was wrong. Some wounds cut too deep to be healed.",male,2007
3148,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,"He barely taught me, though. I always felt more open to it after the lessons. Like he was trying to open me to Voldemort—-",male,2007
3149,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,"I would trust Severus Snape with my life, Harry. You have never recovered from your mistrust of him in your first year.",male,2007
3150,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,Sirius didn't trust him. Didn't believe he'd really turned to our side...,male,2007
3151,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,"Again, some wounds run too deep to be healed, Harry. Severus and Sirius never liked each other at school. This has never changed.",male,2007
3152,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,"During your Occulumency lessons, Professor Snape discovered that you were dreaming about the door in the Department of Mysteries.",male,2007
3153,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,"I've been dreaming about that all year, before Voldemort discovered the connection.",male,2007
3154,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,"Yes. Voldemort has been obsessed with hearing that prophesy since he returned. Because of your scar, what he was obsessed with, you were obsessed with, in the form of dreams.",male,2007
3155,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,"Once he discovered the connection, Voldemort had little difficulty in manipulating you into thinking he had captured Sirius.",male,2007
3156,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,But I checked Grimmauld Place! Kreacher said--,male,2007
3157,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,Kreacher lied. He wanted you to go to the Department of Mysteries.,male,2007
3158,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,Why?,male,2007
3159,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,Kreacher has been serving two masters for some months now.,male,2007
3160,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,What?,male,2007
3161,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,"Wait, where was Sirius when I tried to contact him?",male,2007
3162,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,Ah. Apparently Kreacher had injured Buckbeak to distract him in case you tried to contact Headquarters.,male,2007
3163,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,Sirius was tending to the wounds when you called.,male,2007
3164,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,And Hermione said we should be nice to Kreacher!,male,2007
3165,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,"She was quite right, Harry. Kreacher is what wizards have made him. He is to be pitied, not hated.",male,2007
3166,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,Sirius hated him.,male,2007
3167,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,He didn't hate Kreacher himself. Kreacher was a reminder to Sirius of the home he had always hated.,male,2007
3168,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,"Yeah, he really hated that place. And you kept him locked up in there!",male,2007
3169,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,I was trying to save his life!,male,2007
3170,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,I also knew that Voldemort would return one day. I played to his weakness. There is an ancient magic which Voldemort has always underestimated.,male,2007
3171,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,"This magic is what your mother gave you when she died. That protection would only work, however, if you were cared for by a blood relative. Your Aunt, Petunia.",male,2007
3172,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,She never loved me.,male,2007
3173,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,"Perhaps not. But she took you in, however grudgingly. As long as you can call your Aunt's house your home, you are protected.",male,2007
3174,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,"And now we come to the moment of terrible truth, the moment I have dreaded for fifteen years. The moment when I must lay another burden atop your already straining shoulders.",male,2007
3175,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,Do you remember your first year here? When you lay in the hospital wing fresh from your confrontation with Voldemort?,male,2007
3176,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,Do you remember what you asked me that night?,male,2007
3177,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,I asked you why Voldemort tried to kill me.,male,2007
3178,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,"You have no idea the pain it causes me to tell it to you, even now. But unfortunately, I must.",male,2007
3179,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,"I don't understand, Professor.",male,2007
3180,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,"Professor, why am I so important to",male,2007
3181,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,"An excellent question, Harry. The answer lies in the prophesy.",male,2007
3182,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,"Sir, it got smashed.",male,2007
3183,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,That was not the only place the Prophesy is preserved.,male,2007

3186,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,And...it means me?,male,2007
3187,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,"Interestingly, there were two boys whom the prophesy could have been referring to. You and Neville Longbottom.",male,2007
3188,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,"So it's not necessarily me, sir?",male,2007
3189,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,What if he chose wrong?,male,2007
3190,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,Why didn't he wait? Why attack when we were babies?,male,2007
3191,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,"Voldemort had an informant listening to my meeting with Professor Trelawney. Fortunately he was discovered before he could hear the entire prophesy. Voldemort had to act immediately, he didn't know the rest of the prophesy. All he knew was that he had to destroy the child who would grow to be a threat to his power.",male,2007
3192,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,But I don't have any special powers.,male,2007
3193,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,There is a room in the Department of Mysteries which is kept locked at all times. It contains a force so wonderful and yet terrible that it is greater than death itself. It is that power which you have incredible amounts of and of which Voldemort has none.,male,2007
3194,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,harry potter,"What is it, sir?",male,2007
3195,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The Lost Prophecy,albus dumbledore,"There is only the end of the prophesy which we haven't addressed. It states ""neither can live while the other survives.""",male,2007

Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school.
